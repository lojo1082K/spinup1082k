# spinup1082k

This repo was created by Garrett Payne, programmer for 1082K during the Spin Up season.

The repo for the VEXCode Pro V5 C++ programs of VRCHS Team 1082K



1082K only has one programmer for the Spin Up season, so I won't add any collaborators unless someone reeeeally wants to see it.

Current implementation:
Branches: 
  - Main
    - Will contain this README and other important info about the repository
    - Might end up containing the Driver Code without an Auto
  - Right Side
    - Will contain the program to run for Right Side auton
    - Will also contain Driver Code
  - Left Side
    - Will contain the program to run for Left Side auton
    - Will also contain Driver Code
