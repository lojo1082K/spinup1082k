# spinup1082k

This repo was created by Garrett Payne, programmer for 1082K during the Spin Up season.

The repo for the VEXCode Pro V5 C++ programs of VRCHS Team 1082K



1082K only has one programmer for the Spin Up season, so I won't add any collaborators unless someone reeeeally wants to see it.

Current implementation:

  - ONE Program.
  - When the Program is changed, it is zipped and uploaded to the In-Progress Branch with a pre-release version tag. For example, if the current version is 2.3.4, the       In-Progress version would be 2.3.5.alpha, then 2.3.5.alpha.1 etc.

This repo is webhooked to a channel in our team Discord Server, so ALL changes to the repo get sent there.
